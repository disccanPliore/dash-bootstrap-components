Mongo Santamaria was one of the most influential and versatile percussionists in the history of Latin jazz. Born in Havana, Cuba, in 1917, he started playing the rumba quinto (a high-pitched conga drum) at an early age and soon became a master of Afro-Cuban rhythms. He moved to New York in the 1950s and joined forces with some of the leading jazz musicians of the time, such as Cal Tjader, Dizzy Gillespie, and Tito Puente. He also formed his own band and recorded dozens of albums that showcased his skills on congas, bongos, timbales, and other percussion instruments.
 
Mongo Santamaria's music was a fusion of traditional Cuban folkloric elements and modern jazz harmonies and improvisation. He was known for his creative arrangements, his catchy compositions, and his ability to adapt to different styles and genres. He could play anything from mambo to salsa, from soul-jazz to funk, from Latin rock to disco. He was also famous for his rendition of Herbie Hancock's "Watermelon Man", which became a hit single in 1963 and introduced many listeners to the sound of Latin jazz.
