# How to Update Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor to Version 2.700
 
Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor is a real-time strategy game that features three new campaigns, new multiplayer modes, and new units. The game was released in 2009 and received several patches to fix bugs and improve balance. The latest official patch for the game is version 2.602, which was released in May 2011[^2^]. However, some fans have created unofficial patches that update the game to version 2.700, which is compatible with the popular Eastern Front mod[^3^]. Here is how you can update your game to version 2.700 using these unofficial patches.
 
1. Download the recent Full Version of the Eastern Front mod from [here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/coheastern-front/downloads/eastern-front-250-full). This mod adds the Soviet Union and Ostheer factions to the game, as well as new maps, units, and abilities.

3. Run and install the Full Version of the Eastern Front mod into your Company of Heroes folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Company of Heroes\. Then run and install the compatibility patch into the same folder.

Note: If you want to play online with other players who have version 2.700, you will need to use a third-party service such as GameRanger or Tunngle, as the official servers only support version 2.602.
