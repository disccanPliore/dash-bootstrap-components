If you are an EDM producer, you know how important it is to have a tight and punchy sidechain compression on your tracks. Sidechain compression is a technique that lowers the volume of one sound when another sound plays, creating a rhythmic pumping effect that adds energy and groove to your music.
  
But what if you want more control over your sidechain compression? What if you want to apply different amounts of compression to different frequency bands of your sound? What if you want to use different sidechain sources for different sounds?

Audio mode allows you to trigger the sidechain with an external audio input from another track or a microphone. Sync mode allows you to trigger the sidechain with the host tempo and beat division.

You can choose from Digital, Notch, or Steep filters. Digital filters are smooth and transparent, Notch filters are sharp and resonant, and Steep filters are aggressive and distorted.
- **Sidechain**: This section lets you control the amount and shape of the sidechain compression for each band. You can adjust the threshold, ratio, attack, release, and curve parameters of each band. You can also invert the phase of each band for more creative effects.
- **Output**: This section lets you control the final output of the plugin. You can adjust the volume, pan, and mix parameters of each band. You can also mute or solo each band for easier monitoring.
- **Modulation**: This section lets you modulate some of the sidechain parameters with LFOs and envelopes for more dynamic and expressive effects. You can assign up to four modulation sources to any of the sidechain parameters. You can also adjust the speed, depth, shape, and sync options of each modulation source.
