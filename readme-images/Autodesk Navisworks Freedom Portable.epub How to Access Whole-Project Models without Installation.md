# How to Use Autodesk Navisworks Freedom Portable.epub
 
Autodesk Navisworks Freedom is a free 3D viewer that allows you to view and explore 3D models created with Navisworks software. You can also view NWD files, which are compressed and secure versions of 3D models that can be easily shared and streamed online[^1^] [^4^].

If you want to use Autodesk Navisworks Freedom on a portable device, such as a USB flash drive or an external hard drive, you can download the portable version of the software from this link: [Navisworks 3D Viewer Free Download - Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/products/navisworks/3d-viewers). This version does not require installation and can be run directly from the device[^2^].
 
However, if you want to use the portable version of Autodesk Navisworks Freedom as an epub file, which is a popular format for e-books and digital publications, you will need to convert it first. There are several online tools that can help you with this task, such as [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/epub-to-pdf/) or [Online-Convert](https://www.online-convert.com/file-format/epub). These tools allow you to upload your portable file and choose the output format as epub. Then, you can download the converted file and open it with any epub reader, such as [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) or [Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html).
 
By using Autodesk Navisworks Freedom Portable.epub, you can enjoy the benefits of viewing 3D models on any device that supports epub files, such as smartphones, tablets, e-readers or laptops. You can also adjust the font size, brightness and orientation of the screen to suit your preferences. However, keep in mind that some features of the original 3D viewer may not be available in the epub format, such as zooming, rotating or measuring the models.

## Advantages of Using Navisworks Software
 
Navisworks is a powerful software that can help you improve your BIM (Building Information Modeling) project delivery. It allows you to visualize and unify design and construction data from different sources and formats within a single federated model. You can also identify and resolve clash and interference problems before construction begins, saving time and money on site and in rework[^1^] [^3^] [^4^].
 
Some of the advantages of using Navisworks software are:
 
- It supports more than 60 file formats and integrates with other BIM software such as AutoCAD, Revit, and even point clouds. This makes sharing files and data easier and faster[^3^].
- It simplifies your 3D model to navigate with more fluidity than in Revit. You can also pull measurements and parameters that were input within the native programs[^2^].
- It allows project teams to combine their models in one place, resulting in easier coordination between disciplines. You can also communicate and collaborate with your entire project team by using Navisworks Freedom, a free tool that allows everyone to view and explore the model with an easy-to-use interface[^2^].
- It allows you to run clash detection and generate clash reports between various models and components. This helps you avoid issues on the job site and ensure quality and safety standards[^1^] [^4^].
- It allows you to create photorealistic images and animations with the Autodesk Rendering engine in the cloud. You can also apply real-world lighting conditions and materials to enhance your presentations[^2^].

Navisworks is a fantastic tool for anyone who needs a way to view, coordinate, and simulate a 3D model efficiently. It can help you save a lot of time and money on your BIM projects by identifying and resolving potential problems before they become costly mistakes.
