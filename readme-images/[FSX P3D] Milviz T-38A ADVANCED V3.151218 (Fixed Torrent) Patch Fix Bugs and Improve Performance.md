# How to Fly the Milviz T-38A Advanced in FSX and P3D
 
If you are looking for a realistic and challenging jet trainer for your flight simulator, you might want to check out the Milviz T-38A Advanced. This add-on is a highly detailed and accurate simulation of the Northrop T-38 Talon, the first supersonic trainer in the world. The T-38A has been used by the US Air Force, NASA, and other air forces around the world for decades, and it is still in service today.
 
The Milviz T-38A Advanced is not a simple port of their previous T-38A release, but a completely reworked and enhanced version that features a custom physics and flight dynamics engine, a realistic sound set, high-resolution textures, PBR materials, and many other improvements. The add-on also includes a comprehensive manual, a tutorial video, and several liveries to choose from.

## Startup
 
The startup procedure of the Milviz T-38A Advanced is fairly simple, but you need to follow some steps carefully to avoid any problems. Here is a brief summary of the startup procedure:
 
1. Set the parking brake and turn on the battery switch.
2. Turn on the avionics master switch and tune your radios as desired.
3. Turn on the fuel pumps and set the fuel selector to "Both".
4. Set the throttle to idle and move the engine start switch to "Start". Wait for 12% RPM on both engines.
5. Move both engine ignition switches to "On". The engines should start spooling up.
6. Monitor the engine instruments and wait for 60% RPM on both engines.
7. Turn on the generator switches and check that the electrical system is working properly.
8. Turn on the anti-collision lights, navigation lights, pitot heat, and transponder as required.
9. Perform a flight control check and set your flaps as desired.
10. Release the parking brake and taxi to the runway.

You can also use the auto-start feature by pressing Shift+Ctrl+E. This will start both engines automatically for you.
 
## Takeoff
 
The takeoff of the Milviz T-38A Advanced is exhilarating and fun. You need to be careful with your speed and attitude, as this aircraft can accelerate very quickly and reach supersonic speeds in no time. Here are some tips for a successful takeoff:

- Line up on the runway centerline and apply full throttle. The engines will spool up rapidly and produce a lot of thrust.
- Use gentle rudder inputs to keep the aircraft straight. Do not use too much rudder or you might induce yaw oscillations.
- Lift off at around 150 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). Do not pull too hard on the stick or you might stall or overstress the aircraft.
- Raise the landing gear as soon as possible after liftoff. This will reduce drag and increase your climb performance.
- Raise the flaps when you reach 200 KIAS or above. This will also reduce drag and increase your speed.
- Climb at around 300 KIAS or less until you reach your desired altitude. Do 8cf37b1e13
