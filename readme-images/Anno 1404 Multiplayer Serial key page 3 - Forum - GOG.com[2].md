## Tips and Tricks for Playing Anno 1404
 
Anno 1404 is not just a game about building cities and managing resources. It is also a game that challenges you to explore new lands, trade with other players, and engage in diplomacy or warfare. To help you succeed in your adventure, here are some tips and tricks that you should know before playing Anno 1404.
 
### Create settlements on various islands
 
Not every island has the same resources and goods that you need for your population. You will need to colonize different islands to produce the items that you can't make on your main island. For example, you will need to find an island with iron to produce tools, or an island with spices to satisfy your oriental citizens. You can also use your secondary islands to produce trade goods that you can sell to other players or NPCs for money.
 
### Supply your population with their needs
 
Your population is divided into different classes, such as peasants, citizens, patricians, and noblemen. Each class has different needs that you have to fulfill to make them happy and pay taxes. These needs include food, drink, clothing, faith, entertainment, and more. You can see the needs of each class by clicking on their houses or using the population overview menu. You should try to supply all the needs of your population as much as possible, as this will allow them to upgrade to higher classes and unlock new buildings and technologies.
 
### Do the missions that come out
 
Anno 1404 has a campaign mode that teaches you the basics of the game and introduces you to the different factions and characters. You should play the campaign mode if you are new to the game or want to follow a story. However, even if you play in sandbox mode or multiplayer mode, you will still receive missions from time to time from various NPCs. These missions can range from delivering goods, building structures, exploring areas, fighting enemies, and more. You should try to do these missions as they will reward you with money, items, honor points, or reputation. Honor points can be used to buy special items from the Lord Northburgh or Grand Vizier Al Zahir. Reputation can be used to improve your relations with other players or NPCs and unlock new trade agreements or alliances.
 
### Build a large shipyard and become a ship owner
 
Ships are essential in Anno 1404 as they allow you to transport goods between islands, trade with other players or NPCs, explore new regions, and fight enemies. You should build a large shipyard as soon as possible and start producing ships of different types and sizes. You can build small ships like fishing boats or transport ships for basic tasks, or large ships like warships or oriental ships for advanced purposes. You can also upgrade your ships with items that improve their speed, cargo capacity, combat strength, or special abilities. You should also protect your ships from pirates or hostile players by escorting them with warships or hiring mercenaries from Richard Northburgh.
 
### Gradually raise the level of your population
 
Your population is not only a source of income but also a source of advancement. As you supply your population with their needs, they will upgrade to higher classes and unlock new buildings and technologies for you. For example, you will need citizens to build a church or a tavern, patricians to build a cathedral or a hospital, and noblemen to build a palace or an arsenal. However, you should not rush to upgrade your population too fast, as higher classes have more needs and consume more resources than lower classes. You should balance your production and consumption carefully and make sure you have enough surplus of goods before upgrading your population.
